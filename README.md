# substrings
This Ruby program takes a user-defined string and library and then returns a hash containing the count of each string within the library. If you have Ruby installed locally you can download ruby.rb and run it, or view it online at: https://replit.com/@BenJ8/Substring#main.rb

I later reviewed the solutions of others and realised I could have been more efficient so refactored to cut code lines down by a third while maintaining readability.
